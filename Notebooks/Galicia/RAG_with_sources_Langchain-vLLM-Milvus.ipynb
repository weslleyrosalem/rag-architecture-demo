It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

The notice should include the character of the Assembly, date, time, and location, as well as the Agenda. If a second Assembly is needed due to the failure of the first, it must be held within 30 days and notices published for three days with at least eight days' advance notice. An Ordinary Assembly can be called simultaneously for the first and second convocation. If the second Assembly is scheduled for the same day as the first, there must be an hour-long interval between them.\n",

This consent can be given in a Special Assembly regulated by these statutes.

In case of a tie, the President has a double vote. The Directorate meetings can be held via videoconference under certain conditions, including having the necessary hardware and software, holding the meeting at the social headquarters, and the Director participating remotely notifying the meeting in advance.
